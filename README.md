# Sample express server for bookmarks app!

This (hopefully) fulfills the Thinkful assignment to create an Express app with API endpoints and logging, correctly modularizing and layering my code, and built from my express boilerplate. 

## Scripts

Start nodemon for the application `npm run dev`

Run the tests `npm test`
